## **Motivation**
This is my first react project. I have made it while learning the basics of react with the course of the amazing Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. This marks the beginning of my journey within web development and I'm certainly eager to learn more about this field.

## **Description**
The project is an expenses tracker. It uses almost all of the core basics of React including components, props, state with the the use of State Hook, lifting state up, dynamic styling of the components, rendering lists and controlling the inputs.
